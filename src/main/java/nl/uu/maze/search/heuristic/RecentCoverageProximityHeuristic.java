/**
 * Recent Coverage Heuristic (RCH).
 * <p>
 * Prioritizes targets that have recently discovered new code, focusing on
 * "hot" exploration paths. This helps concentrate resources on targets that
 * are actively expanding coverage rather than those that may have stagnated.
 * <p>
 * In particular, this strategy focuses on the proximity of recent coverage,
 * i.e., how many instructions were executed since the last time a previously
 * uncovered instruction was executed.
