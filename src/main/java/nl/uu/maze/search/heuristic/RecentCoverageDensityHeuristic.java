 * Recent Coverage Density Heuristic (RCDH).

 * "hot" exploration paths. This helps concentrate resources on targets that
 * are actively expanding coverage rather than those that may have stagnated.
 * <p>
 * In particular, this strategy focuses on the density of recent coverage, i.e.,
 * then number of newly covered instructions that were covered within a recent
 * window.
